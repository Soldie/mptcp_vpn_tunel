Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an ongoing effort to extend TCP by allowing a
connection to use multiple paths in order to improve resource usage efficiency
and offer redundancy. Despite having a working implementation, it still faces
obstacles before large scale deployment. This study presents the results of an
analysis of MPTCP's behavior in a controlled environment, aiming to understand
how link parameters affect performance. The final goal of the project is to
devise a system that allows users to bypass egress firewalls using MPTCP,
OpenVPN and tunneling traffic via common protocols.
