Network applications that can adapt and maximize their throughput despite restrictive firewall conditions enjoy great popularity among users. The goal of this research project is to use Multipath TCP (MPTCP) over OpenVPN in order to tunnel traffic via common protocols, enabling users behind a firewall to obtain maximum throughput from their applications. The first stage of the project was an analysis of how link parameters affect MPTCP performance. In the second stage, MPTCP was deployed over OpenVPN and ideal throughput-maximizing system and network configurations were identified. In the third stage, we analyze one of the most important parameters observed in stage two: the congestion algorithm. Several algorithms are tested and the results are compared.
