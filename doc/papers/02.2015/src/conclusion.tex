We have performed experiments to compare the performance of two MPTCP congestion algorithms that use different approaches to congestion control. While OLIA has consistently achieved better throughput in experiments, wVegas has maintained a more stable throughput across the test time interval due to its delay-based approach which prevents packet losses. Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks. They can complement each other, therefore a solution that combines them could prove extremely beneficial.

This report concludes the investigation and optimization stage of the project. We have identified all the necessary configurations that can contribute to achieving maximum throughput for tunneled MPTCP traffic. With all the tools in place, future work consists of the implementation of a system that dynamically creates MPTCP OpenVPN tunnels based on available unfiltered protocols.
