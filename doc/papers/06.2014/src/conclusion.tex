We have performed experiments to determine the influence of using MPTCP on
tunneled traffic with the end goal of offering both high throughput, as well
as encrypted communication. We have focused on avoiding cached TCP parameters
and determining optimal buffer sizes. Our results show that MPTCP is able to
move traffic from a congested path to a less congested alternative and that
the best behavior is achieved when the socket buffer is twice the size of the
bandwidth-delay product. Any less than that and the buffer is not large enough
to cope with long fat networks and anything larger wastes memory which also
leads to decreased performance. While encrypting the traffic induces some
penalty, we consider it avoidable in a setup which does not exhibit several
layers of virtualization, which is the case with our testbed.

With regards to future work, the next step is moving to a testbed with
multiple virtual machines, in order to reduce the amount of virtualization we
are performing. Additionally, we will devise a system that dynamically creates
OpenVPN tunnels based on available unfiltered protocols and use MPTCP to
counter the performance loss added by encapsulating traffic.
